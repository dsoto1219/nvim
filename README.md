# My Neovim Configuration

These are the contents of my `$LOCALAPPDATA/nvim` directory on my (Windows) computer. I keep them here to sync changes across computers, and I keep this repository public in case anyone is interested in seeing how I've configured neovim. 

A number of configuration choices here are inspired by chris@machine's [Neovim From Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ) playlist on YouTube.

As of now, the range of plugins that I have installed are limited, but I plan to expand on that soon.
