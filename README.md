# My Neovim Configuration

These are the contents of my $LOCALAPPDATA/nvim directory. I keep them here to sync changes across computers, and I keep this repository public in case anyone is interested in seeing how I've configured neovim. 

A number of configuration choices here are inspired by chris@machine's [Neovim From Scratch](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ) playlist on YouTube.
